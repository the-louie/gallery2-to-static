# gallery2-to-static
Generate a static copy of your Menalto Gallery 2 structure

## What
This script is meant to be used to create a static archive of a Gallery 2. It reads the database and 
creates a static directory structure and HTML files to display the albums. 

## Why
Since Menalto seased development of the Gallery product it's almost impossible to maintain a secure
gallery. So the options are to convert to another gallery like Flikr or Piwig, or just create a
static dump of the current state. This does the latter.

## How
Under development :P
