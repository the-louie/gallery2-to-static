# Classic theme implementation (formerly "Original")

The "Classic" theme (renamed from "Original" in 2026-02) was added as a third selectable theme alongside Light and Dark. It reproduces the Gallery 2 Classic (lanbilder.se) colour palette and semantics: white and light grey backgrounds (#fff, #eee, #e7e7e7), dark grey text (#333), blue links (#6b8cb7) with orange hover (#f4560f), metadata grey (#888), borders (#ccc), and focus/current accent (#0b6cff). The source of truth for colours and typography is the design analysis document 2026-01-25-1200_original_design_analyzis_1.md (Refinement from downloaded site). Theme registration is in frontend src/config/themes.ts; CSS variables for Classic are in frontend src/styles/themes.css under [data-theme="classic"]. ThemeContext exposes isClassic; ThemeDropdown shows Classic with a classic/frame icon. The classic two-column layout (sidebar 175px + main) was deferred; Classic uses the same single-column layout as Light and Dark with only colours and component tokens differing.
