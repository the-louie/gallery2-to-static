# Roadmap

Backlog: `TODO.md` (repo root). Sprints are scope-boxed (~20–40h, tickets 1–4h) and end on a demo.

**After every sprint (operator, 2026-10-25):** prune `TODO.md` and regenerate `TODO-summarized.md`: `python3 docs/planning/prune_todo.py . "Sprint NN"` moves closed (~~struck~~) rows, with their proof, to `docs/planning/done.md`.

**Active sprint:** [Sprint 04](./sprints/sprint-04.md) — in progress.
**Current ticket:** [Sprint 04 T-07](./sprints/sprint-04.md) (`in-progress` — ESLint 10 flat config, typescript-eslint 8, react-hooks 7, react-refre)
**Last completed:** Sprint 04 T-06 (commit `5b9dee4`).

| Sprint | Goal |
|---|---|
| S01 ✅ | Green, safe production build: `npm run build` passes from a clean checkout, `dist/` holds no images, sourcemaps or bundle report; the two P1 frontend blockers (search ReDoS, stuck path resolver) fixed. |
| S02 ✅ | Data correctness in the backend: path segments computed once (LOGIC-11), thumbnail failure handling + sharp upgrade (LOGIC-12, SEC-14, LOGIC-13), run robustness (LOGIC-21..23). |
| S03 ✅ | Frontend behaviour: grid bandwidth (PERF-01..03), lightbox (LOGIC-16, 17, 19), filters/sort (LOGIC-18, 25, 29), error paths (LOGIC-20). |
| S04 | DEPS-01 frontend half (latest vite/vitest/eslint/React, one toolchain per ticket) + backend typescript/ts-node; SEC-18 brotli check. |
| S05+ | P3 items, SEC-18 brotli check, hygiene, test-fixture type burn-down (BUILD-01 rest, LINT-01). DECISION-01 (hosting) with the operator. SEC-12 (permissions) when the Gallery 2 DB is available to test against. |
