## Implement Per-Album Theme Configuration

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

### Description
Implement per-album theme configuration system that allows each album to have either no theme assigned (uses default theme) or a specific theme. If a specific theme is assigned but doesn't exist, fallback to default theme. Configuration is stored in a JSON file optimized for human editing.

### Requirements

#### Research Tasks
- Research JSON configuration file patterns for human editing (comments, formatting, validation)
- Research theme lookup and application patterns in React context
- Research album ID matching strategies (string vs number, path-based)
- Research configuration file location and loading strategies (static import vs fetch)
- Research configuration validation and error handling patterns

#### Implementation Tasks
- Create `album-themes.json` configuration file in project root with human-friendly structure
- Design JSON schema: default theme field and album themes mapping (album ID → theme name)
- Create TypeScript types/interfaces for theme configuration
- Create utility function to load and parse theme configuration file
- Implement theme lookup function: get theme for album ID with fallback to default
- Extend ThemeContext to support per-album theme lookup
- Integrate per-album theme resolution in AlbumDetail and routing components
- Add configuration validation (theme names must exist, album IDs must be valid)
- Handle configuration loading errors gracefully (fallback to default theme)
- Add configuration file example/documentation
- Write tests for theme configuration loading
- Write tests for theme lookup with fallback logic
- Write tests for invalid configuration handling

### Deliverable
Per-album theme configuration system with JSON file and theme resolution logic

### Testing Requirements
- Verify albums without theme assignment use default theme
- Check albums with valid theme assignment use specified theme
- Ensure albums with invalid theme assignment fallback to default
- Verify configuration file parsing handles various formats correctly
- Check error handling when configuration file is missing or malformed
- Review configuration file is easy to edit manually

### Technical Notes
- Configuration file should be optimized for human editing (clear structure, comments if possible, readable formatting)
- Theme lookup should be efficient (consider caching parsed configuration)
- Fallback logic is critical: invalid themes must not break the application
- Configuration validation should provide clear error messages
- JSON file location should be easily accessible for manual editing
- Theme resolution should integrate seamlessly with existing ThemeContext
