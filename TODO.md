# TODO

Backlog rebuilt 2026-10-25 from a colleague's review list, after verifying every claim
against the code at `61c80e6`. Numbering continues the existing `SEC-`/`LOGIC-`/`ARCH-`
series (see `.claude/plans/`); `BUILD-`, `PERF-` and `TEST-` are new prefixes.

**Verification summary:** 8 of 10 "must fix" items confirmed as described, 2 confirmed
with a materially different mechanism (#7, #8), 1 understated by a wide margin (#1).
The reported test failures (214/1249) could **not** be reproduced — see TEST-01.

## P0 — Blocks all other work

Nothing below this line can be validated until the build runs.

## P1 — Must be fixed before anything is published

### SENTRY-01: create and set up Sentry projects for this application (operator, 2026-10-25, high prio)

Operator request, verbatim: "Help me create and set up Sentry projects for this application." Org slug: `telamon-it`; run code: `666248c9ac`. Install (operator, 2026-10-25): `npx @sentry/agent-plugin install telamon-it#666248c9ac` — read what the package does before running it (it is third-party code run with npx). Scope to settle when scheduled: one project per part (frontend SPA, backend extractor), DSNs kept out of the repo, source maps only from `--mode analyze` builds or uploaded, not shipped (`scripts/check-dist.mjs`), and what is sent (no IPs/PII by default).

### LINT-02: review the @eslint-react rules that are off (Sprint 08 T-02)

Moving to ESLint 10 replaced eslint-plugin-react with @eslint-react, whose `recommended-typescript` set adds rules the old set did not have. They fired 75 times and are off in `frontend/eslint.config.js` so the lint coverage stays as before: `set-state-in-effect` 49, `no-array-index-key` 7, `use-state` 5, `no-context-provider` 3, `no-use-context` 3, `naming-convention-ref-name` 2, `web-api-no-leaked-intersection-observer` 1 (`exhaustive-deps` 5 duplicates react-hooks and stays off). Review each: fix real bugs (the leaked IntersectionObserver first), turn the rule on, or keep it off with a reason.

## P2 — Correctness and cost

## P3 — Quality, hygiene and latent bugs

## Added 2026-10-25: second pass of the review, verified at `c750fbf`

These come from the full review (`code-review-rc1.md`, items B1–B16 and C), which was written
against the older `9790743`. Each one was re-checked against `c750fbf`; only items that are still
open are listed here. The items already fixed are at the end of "Not reproduced / no action".

### P1 additions

### P2 additions

### P3 additions

## Not reproduced / no action

- **"No XSS path and no committed secrets"** — confirmed for secrets. `backend/config.json`
  is ignored at `.gitignore:1`, has never appeared in any of the 228 commits
  (`git log --all -- backend/config.json` is empty), and no `.env`/secret/credential file is
  tracked among the 375 tracked files. Note the file does hold a plaintext password on disk,
  which is why SEC-14's `mysql2` advisory matters.
- **"214 of 1249 tests fail"** — see TEST-01. Not reproducible; please confirm the source.
- **Already fixed at `c750fbf` (from the second pass, no action):**
  - stale album response after fast back/forward: `useAlbumData` `requestIdRef` (LOGIC-01);
  - thumbnail path traversal: `validateNoTraversal` (SEC-05) and component checks (SEC-11);
  - `/album/7abc` accepted: strict `/^\d+$/` in `routeParams.ts`;
  - raw `ownerId` in the output: rows are now mapped field by field (LOGIC-05), `ownerId` is not emitted.
- **Not re-verified:** per-album themes for paths with é/æ/ø (`albumThemesConfig.ts`, depends on
  whether `location.pathname` is percent-encoded under `HashRouter`). Check in a browser.

## FUTURE (after production deploy)

Operator, 2026-10-25. Not scheduled until lanbilder.se runs on the new code. The notes under each
row are first answers to the questions asked, to verify when the row is planned.

### FUT-01: SQLite as the master of the data; regenerate only changed branches

All data in a SQLite database whose schema preserves everything the JSON carries (albums, images,
paths, breadcrumbs, highlight images, descriptions, owners, counts, themes). The database is the
master; the JSON files are generated from it. Every album/image row records when it last changed,
so a run regenerates only the affected branch (the albums on the path from the root to the changed
item, plus their search-index entries) instead of the whole tree.
- First import: from the Gallery 2 extraction (the current backend), then Gallery 2 is retired.
- Changed-at must propagate: a changed image marks its album and every ancestor (counts, highlight)
  dirty. Deletes must be recorded too (tombstones), so stale JSON is reported (see LOGIC-22's
  no-delete policy).
- Fits DECISION-01 either way: the generator writes the same static files.

### FUT-02: admin can add albums and delegate them; delegated users add subalbums and images

An ADMIN creates an album and delegates it to a user; that user can create subalbums and
upload/add images under it. Requirements (operator):
- Authentication **must** be secure: federated login (GitHub / Google / Facebook were named).
- The admin part is **not linked** from the gallery, lives on its **own, not easily guessed
  subdomain**, and its code must **not be served at all** to unauthenticated users (separate build
  and origin, not a hidden route in the public SPA).
- Enforce login in Cloudflare (Access application on the admin hostname), and verify again in our
  backend, independently of Cloudflare, that the authenticated identity is on our own user list,
  without a second login: validate the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` JWT (signature against the team's
  public keys, `aud`, expiry) and map its subject/email to our user table.
- Authorisation: a user ↔ album table (0..n albums per user, inherited down the subtree); every
  write checks it in the backend.
- MFA, not email-based (token or key): to research. GitHub can require 2FA for members of an
  organisation; Google can enforce it only for Workspace accounts; whether Cloudflare Access can
  require MFA for social logins must be checked. A dependable option is our own WebAuthn/passkey
  step in the admin backend after the Access login.
- Uploads go through the image pipeline (sharp, failOn, size limits, EXIF strip) and into FUT-01's
  database, then trigger a branch regeneration.

### FUT-03: user profiles

Each user has a profile with a nickname and a profile picture. The federated providers usually
supply a display name and a picture (Google: `name`, `picture`; GitHub: `login`, `name`,
`avatar_url`; Facebook: name and picture): check what reaches us through Cloudflare Access (the
JWT, `/cdn-cgi/access/get-identity`) and copy it at first login, editable afterwards. Also worth
having: a stable internal user id (not the email), the linked provider identities, role (admin /
user), the delegated albums, created/last-login timestamps, and an "enabled" flag to lock a user
out without deleting them. Pictures should be stored by us (not hot-linked from the provider).

### FUT-04: audit logging

Every user action, login and other event is logged, successful or not: logins and denials (ours
and Cloudflare Access's audit log), album/image create/edit/delete/upload, delegation changes,
profile changes, admin actions, failed authorisation checks. Append-only (writes only, no
updates/deletes from the application), with timestamp, user id, source IP (`CF-Connecting-IP`),
action, target, result. Decide retention and who can read it.

### FUT-05: privacy-friendly statistics (European)

Visitor statistics similar to Google Analytics, preferably a European service with a healthier
privacy policy. Candidates to compare: Matomo (France; can be self-hosted), Plausible (EU, Estonia;
has a self-hostable Community Edition), Simple Analytics (Netherlands), Pirsch (Germany). Prefer
cookieless operation (no consent banner) and a self-hosted or EU-hosted instance. Any of them adds a
script/endpoint origin to the CSP (`script-src`, `connect-src`). Cloudflare Web Analytics exists but
is not European.
