We need to do a review of the implementation of the plan below

Look for missing implementation, common misstakes, bad patterns and other problems.
Take extra time and check for:
- Missing functionality
- Partly implemented functionality
- Ineffective implementations
- Incorrect implementations according to the plan

Also check:
- Bugs
- Logical Errors
- Unwanted side-effects
- Compability problems with existing APIs
- Compability problems with existing code
- That the TODO item is removed properly from @TODO.md and @TODO-summarized.md

Important rules for this task:
- do not create any additional documentation.
- create a todo list detailing the issues found
- use the todo list to go through each issue and implement a well researched fix
- for each fixed issue mark the todo item as completed.
- after you completed all steps double-check so that each todo-item is actualy implemented and done.
- do not run any terminal commands

The plan:
