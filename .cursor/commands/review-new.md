Look for all common misstakes, bad patterns and other problems.
Take extra time and check for:
- Bugs
- Logical Errors
- Unwanted side-effects
- Compability problems with existing APIs
- Compability problems with existing code

do not create any additional documentation.
create a todo list detailing the issues found
use the todo list to go through each issue and implement a well researched fix
for each fixed issue mark the todo item as completed.
after you completed all steps double-check so that each todo-item is actualy implemented and done.
